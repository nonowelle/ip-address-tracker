## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

- Live Site URL: [Live Demo](https://ip-address-tracker-master-oa6rtgjs3-nonowelles-projects.vercel.app/)

### Built With

- **Vue 3** - Progressive JavaScript framework
- **Vue Composition API** - For reactive state management and component logic
- **Leaflet.js** - Open-source library for interactive maps
- **IPify Geolocation API** - For IP address geolocation data
- **SCSS** - CSS preprocessor for enhanced styling

### What I Learned

Working on this project helped me strengthen my understanding of several key concepts:

**Vue Composition API**: I became more comfortable with the reactive system and how to structure component logic using the Composition API pattern.

**Integrating Third-party APIs**: I learned how to work with the ipify API.

**Interactive Maps with Leaflet**: Implementing dynamic map functionality, including updating map markers and centering the view based on geolocation data.

### Continued Development

Areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects:

- **Error Handling**: Implementing more robust error handling for API failures and edge cases
- **Testing**: Adding unit tests for component logic and API interactions
- **Accessibility**: Improving keyboard navigation and screen reader support for map interactions

### Useful Resources

- [Vue 3 Composition API Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html) - Essential for understanding the reactive system and composition patterns
- [Leaflet.js Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html) - Comprehensive guide for map functionality and customization
- [IPify API Documentation](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - Clear documentation for the geolocation API endpoints
